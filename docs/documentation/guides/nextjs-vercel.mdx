title: "Next.js + Vercel"
---


This guide demonstrates how to use Gsoc2 to manage secrets for your Next.js + Vercel stack from local development to production. It uses:

- Gsoc2 (you can use [Gsoc2 Cloud](https://app.gsoc2.com) or a [self-hosted instance of Gsoc2](https://gsoc2.com/docs/self-hosting/overview)) to store your secrets.

## Project Setup

To begin, we need to set up a project in Gsoc2 and add secrets to an environment in it.

### Create a project

1. Create a new project in [Gsoc2](https://app.gsoc2.com/).

2. Add a secret to the development environment of this project so we can pull it back for local development. In the **Secrets Overview** page, press **Explore Development** and add a secret with the key `NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME` and value `YOUR_NAME`.

3. Add a secret to the production environment of this project so we can sync it to Vercel. Switch to the **Production** environment and add a secret with the key `NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME` and value `ANOTHER_NAME`.

## Create a Next.js app

Initialize a new Node.js app.

We can use `create-next-app` to initialize an app called `gsoc2-nextjs`.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="JavaScript">
        ```console
        npx create-next-app@latest --use-npm gsoc2-nextjs
        cd gsoc2-nextjs
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="TypeScript">
        ```console
        npx create-next-app@latest --ts --use-npm gsoc2-nextjs
        cd gsoc2-nextjs
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, inside `pages/_app.js`, lets add a `console.log()` to print out the environment variable in the browser console.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="JavaScript">
    ```js
    import '@/styles/globals.css'

    export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
        console.log('Hello, ', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME);
        return <Component {...pageProps} />
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```tsx
    import '@/styles/globals.css'
    import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

    export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
        console.log('Hello, ', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME);
        return <Component {...pageProps} />
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Gsoc2 CLI for local development environment variables

We'll now use the Gsoc2 CLI to fetch secrets from Gsoc2 into your Next.js app for local development.

### CLI Installation

Follow the instructions for your operating system to install the Gsoc2 CLI.

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="MacOS">
  	Use [brew](https://brew.sh/) package manager

    	```console
    	$ brew install gsoc2/get-cli/gsoc2
    	```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Windows">
      Use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) package manager

        ```console
        $ scoop bucket add org https://github.com/Gsoc2/scoop-gsoc2.git
        ```

        ```console
        $ scoop install gsoc2
        ```
   </Tab>
	 <Tab title="Alpine">
	 Install prerequisite
		```console
		$ apk add --no-cache bash sudo
		```

    	Add Gsoc2 repository
    	```console
    	$ curl -1sLf \
    		'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/gsoc2/gsoc2-cli/setup.alpine.sh' \
    		| bash
    	```

    	Then install CLI
    	```console
    	$ apk update && sudo apk add gsoc2
    	```

   </Tab>
	 <Tab title="RedHat/CentOs/Amazon">
	 Add Gsoc2 repository
		```console
		$ curl -1sLf \
		'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/gsoc2/gsoc2-cli/setup.rpm.sh' \
		| sudo -E bash
		```

    	Then install CLI
    	```console
    	$ sudo yum install gsoc2
    	```

   </Tab>
	 <Tab title="Debian/Ubuntu">
	 	Add Gsoc2 repository 
			
		```console
		$ curl -1sLf \
		'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/gsoc2/gsoc2-cli/setup.deb.sh' \
		| sudo -E bash
		```

    	Then install CLI
    	```console
    	$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gsoc2
    	```

   </Tab>
	<Tab title="Arch Linux">
		Use the `yay` package manager to install from the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gsoc2-bin)
			
		```console
		$ yay -S gsoc2-bin
		```

   </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Login

Authenticate the CLI with the Gsoc2 platform using your email and password.

```console
$ gsoc2 login
```

### Initialization

Run the `init` command at the root of the Next.js app. This step connects your local project to the project on the Gsoc2 platform and creates a `gsoc2.json` file containing a reference to that latter project.

```console
$ gsoc2 init
```

### Start the Next.js app with secrets injected as environment variables

```console
$ gsoc2 run -- npm run dev
```

If you open your browser console, **Hello, YOUR_NAME** should be printed out.

Here, the CLI fetched the secret from Gsoc2 and injected it into the Next.js app upon starting up. By default,
the CLI fetches secrets from the development environment which has the slug `dev`; you can inject secrets from different
environments by modifying the `env` flag as per the [CLI documentation](/cli/usage).

At this stage, you know how to use the Gsoc2 CLI to inject secrets into your Next.js app for local development.

## Gsoc2-Vercel integration for production environment variables

We'll now use the Gsoc2-Vercel integration send secrets from Gsoc2 to Vercel as production environment variables.

### Gsoc2-Vercel integration

To begin we have to import the Next.js app into Vercel as a project. [Follow these instructions](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app/deploy) to deploy the Next.js app to Vercel.

Next, navigate to your project's integrations tab in Gsoc2 and press on the Vercel tile to grant Gsoc2 access to your Vercel account.

![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

![integrations vercel authorization](../../images/integrations-vercel-auth.png)

<Note>
    Opting in for the Gsoc2-Vercel integration will break end-to-end encryption since Gsoc2 will be able to read
    your secrets. This is, however, necessary for Gsoc2 to sync the secrets to Vercel.

    Your secrets remain encrypted at rest following our [security guide mechanics](/security/mechanics).
</Note>

Now select **Production** for (the source) **Environment** and sync it to the **Production Environment** of the (target) application in Vercel.
Lastly, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Vercel.

![integrations vercel](../../images/integrations-vercel-create.png)
![integrations vercel](../../images/integrations-vercel.png)

You should now see your secret from Gsoc2 appear as production environment variables in your Vercel project.

At this stage, you know how to use the Gsoc2-Vercel integration to sync production secrets from Gsoc2 to Vercel.

<Warning>
  The following environment variable names are reserved by Vercel and cannot be
  synced: `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV`, `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_GROUP_NAME`,
  `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`,
  `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE`, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION`,
  `NOW_REGION`, `TZ`, `LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT`, `LAMBDA_RUNTIME_DIR`,
  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`,
  `AWS_REGION`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`.
</Warning>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Why should I use Gsoc2 if I can centralize all my Next.js + Vercel environment variables across all environments directly in Vercel?">
        Vercel does not specialize in secret management which means it lacks many useful features for effectively managing environment variables.
        Here are some features that teams benefit from by using Gsoc2 together with Vercel:

        - Audit logs: See which team members are creating, reading, updating, and deleting environment variables across all environments.
        - Versioning and point in time recovery: Rolling back secrets and an entire project state.
        - Overriding secrets that should be unique amongst team members.

        And much more.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Is opting out of end-to-end encryption for the Gsoc2-Vercel integration safe?">
        Yes. Your secrets are still encrypted at rest. To note, most secret managers actually don't support end-to-end encryption.
        
        Check out the [security guide](/security/overview).
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Is there way to retain end-to-end encryption for syncing production secrets to Vercel?">
        Yes. You can also use the Gsoc2 [Node SDK](https://github.com/Gsoc2/gsoc2-node) to fetch secrets back to your Next.js app
        in both development and production.

        Depending on how you use it, however, it may require certain pages to be server-side rendered.
