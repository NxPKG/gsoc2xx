## Gsoc2 API

The Gsoc2 API (sometimes referred to as the **backend**) contains the core platform logic.

## Storage backend

Gsoc2 relies on a storage backend to store data including users and secrets.

Currently, the only supported storage backend is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) but we plan to add support for other options including PostgreSQL in Q1 2024.

## Redis

Gsoc2 uses [Redis](https://redis.com) to enable more complex workflows including a queuing system to manage long running asynchronous tasks, cron jobs, as well as reliable cache for frequently used resources.

## Gsoc2 Web UI

The Web UI is the browser-based portal that connects to the Gsoc2 API.

## Gsoc2 clients

Clients are any application or infrastructure that connecting to the Gsoc2 API using one of the below methods:
- Public API: Making API requests directly to the Gsoc2 API.
- Client SDK: A platform-specific library with method abstractions for working with secrets. Currently, there are two official SDKs: [Node SDK](https://github.com/Gsoc2/gsoc2-node) and [Python SDK](https://github.com/Gsoc2/gsoc2-python).
- CLI: A terminal-based interface for interacting with the Gsoc2 API.
- Kubernetes Operator: This operator retrieves secrets from Gsoc2 and securely store
