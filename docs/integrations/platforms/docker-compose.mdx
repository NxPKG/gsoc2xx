description: "How to use Gsoc2 to inject environment variables into services defined in your Docker Compose file."

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Gsoc2 Cloud](https://app.gsoc2.com)

## Configure the Gsoc2 CLI for each service

Follow this [guide](./docker) to configure the Gsoc2 CLI for each service that you wish to inject environment variables into; you'll have to update the Dockerfile of each service.

## Generate service token 

Generate a unique [Gsoc2 Token](/documentation/platform/token) for each service.

## Feed service token to your Docker Compose file

For each service you want to inject secrets into, set an environment variable called `GSOC2_TOKEN` equal to a unique identifier variable.

In the example below, we set `GSOC2_TOKEN_FOR_WEB` and `GSOC2_TOKEN_FOR_API` as the `GSOC2_TOKEN` for the services.

```yaml
# Example Docker Compose file
services:
  web:
    build: .
    image: example-service-1
    environment:
      - GSOC2_TOKEN=${GSOC2_TOKEN_FOR_WEB}

  api:
    build: .
    image: example-service-2
    environment:
      - GSOC2_TOKEN=${GSOC2_TOKEN_FOR_API}
```

## Export shell variables

Next, set the shell variables you defined in your compose file. This can be done manually or via your CI/CD environment. Once done, it will be used to populate the corresponding `GSOC2_TOKEN`
in your Docker Compose file.

```bash
#Example

# Token refers to the token we generated in step 2 for this service
export GSOC2_TOKEN_FOR_WEB=<token>

# Token refers to the token we generated in step 2 for this service
export GSOC2_TOKEN_FOR_API=<token>

# Then run your compose file in the same terminal.
docker-compose ...
```
