  <Warning>
  Gsoc2 integrates with Netlify's new environment variable experience. If
  your site uses Netlify's old environment variable experience, you'll have to
  upgrade it to the new one to use this integration.
</Warning>

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Gsoc2 Cloud](https://app.gsoc2.com)

## Navigate to your project's integrations tab

![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

## Authorize Gsoc2 for Netlify

Press on the Netlify tile and grant Gsoc2 access to your Netlify account.

![integrations netlify authorization](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-auth.png)

<Info>
  If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
  Gsoc2 access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
  breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Gsoc2 to sync the environment variables to
  the cloud platform.
</Info>

## Start integration

Select which Gsoc2 environment secrets you want to sync to which Netlify app and context. Lastly, press create integration to start syncing secrets to Netlify.

  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Setup">
    Using the Netlify integration on a self-hosted instance of Gsoc2 requires configuring an OAuth application in Netlify
  and registering your instance with it.
  
  ## Create an OAuth application in Netlify
  
  Navigate to your User settings > Applications > OAuth to create a new OAuth application.
  
   ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-user-settings.png) 
   ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-new-app.png) 
    
    Create the OAuth application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/integrations/netlify/oauth2/callback`.

   ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-new-app-form.png) 

   ## Add your Netlify OAuth application credentials to Gsoc2
   
   Obtain the **Client ID** and **Secret** for your Netlify OAuth application.
   
   ![integrations Netlify config](../../images/integrations/netlify/integrations-netlify-config-credentials.png) 
   
   Back in your Gsoc2 instance, add two new environment variables for the credentials of your Netlify OAuth application.

   - `CLIENT_ID_NETLIFY`: The **Client ID** of your Netlify OAuth application.
   - `CLIENT_SECRET_NETLIFY`: The **Secret** of your Netlify OAuth application.
   
  Once added, restart your Gsoc2 instance and use the Netlify integration.
