description: "How to use Gsoc2 to inject environment variables and secrets into a Vue.js app."
---

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Gsoc2 Cloud](https://app.gsoc2.com)
- [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize Gsoc2 for your [Vue](https://vuejs.org) app

```bash
# navigate to the root of your of your project 
cd /path/to/project

# then initialize gsoc2
gsoc2 init
```

## Start your application as usual but with Gsoc2

```bash
gsoc2 run -- <your application start command>

# Example
gsoc2 run -- npm run dev
```

<Note>
  Note that for environment variables to be exposed to the client, you'll have
  to prefix them with `VUE_APP` Read more about that
  [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html).
