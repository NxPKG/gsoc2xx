description: "How to use Gsoc2 to inject environment variables into Java Spring Boot"
---

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add your environment variables to [Gsoc2 Cloud](https://app.gsoc2.com)
- [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize Gsoc2 
In order for Gsoc2 to know which secrets to fetch, you'll need to first initialize Gsoc2 at the root of your project. 

```bash
# navigate to the root of your of your project 
cd /path/to/project

# then initialize Gsoc2
gsoc2 init
```


## Start your application with Maven wrapper
To pass in Gsoc2 secrets into your application, we will utilize the Gsoc2 CLI to inject the secrets into the Maven wrapper executable, which is used to launch your application. 
The Maven wrapper executable should already be present in the root directory of your project.

```bash 
gsoc2 run -- ./mvnw spring-boot:run --quiet
```

#### Accessing injected secrets 
```java example.java
  ...
  import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;

  @SpringBootApplication
  public class DemoApplication {
    @Autowired
    private Environment env;

    @Bean
    public void someMethod() {
        System.out.println(env.getProperty("SOME_SECRET_NAME"));
      };
  }
```


## Debugging with secrets 
During the process of debugging your code, it may be necessary to have certain environment variables available. To inject these variables for the purpose of debugging, please follow the instructions provided below.
Note that these instructions are currently only available for IntelliJ.

```

**Step 5:** When you need to run a block of code in debug mode, select the Gsoc2 script
