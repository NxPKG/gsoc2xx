Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Gsoc2 Cloud](https://app.gsoc2.com)
- [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize Gsoc2 for your [Bun](https://bun.sh)

```bash
# navigate to the root of your of your project 
cd /path/to/project

# then initialize gsoc2
gsoc2 init
```

## Start your application as usual but with Gsoc2

```bash
gsoc2 run -- <your application start command>

gsoc2 run -- bun run dev
```

<Info>
  Bun environment variables can be called as either `Bun.env.SECRET` or `process.env.SECRET`. We also recommend you check this more in-depth [guide to environment variables in Bun](https://gsoc2.com/blog/bun-environment-variables).
