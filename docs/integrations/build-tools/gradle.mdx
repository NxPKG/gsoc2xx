# Using Gsoc2 with Gradle

By integrating [Gsoc2 CLI](../../cli/overview) with Gradle, you can configure your builds and scripts to different environments, CI/CD pipelines, and more without explicitly setting variables in the command line.

This documentation provides an overview of how to use Gsoc2 with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

## Basic Usage

To run a Gradle task with Gsoc2, you can use the `run` command. The basic structure is:

```
gsoc2 run -- [Your command here]
```

For example, to run the `generateFile` task in Gradle:

```groovy build.gradle
task generateFile {
    doLast {
        String content = System.getenv('ENV_NAME_FROM_GSOC2') ?: 'Default Content'
        file('output.txt').text = content
        println "Generated output.txt with content: $content"
    }
}
```

```
gsoc2 run -- gradle generateFile
```

With this command, Gsoc2 will automatically inject the environment variables associated with the current Gsoc2 project into the Gradle process. 
Your Gradle script can then access these variables using `System.getenv('VARIABLE_NAME')`.

## More Examples

### 1. Building a Project with a Specific Profile

Assuming you have different build profiles (e.g., 'development', 'production'), you can use Gsoc2 to switch between them:

```
gsoc2 run -- gradle build
```

Inside your `build.gradle`, you might have:

```groovy build.gradle
if (System.getenv('PROFILE') == 'production') {
    // production-specific configurations
}
```

### 2. Running Tests with Different Database Configurations

If you want to run tests against different database configurations:

```
gsoc2 run -- gradle test
```

Your test configuration in `build.gradle` can then adjust the database URL accordingly:

```groovy build.gradle
test {
    systemProperty 'db.url', System.getenv('DB_URL')
}
```

### 3. Generating Artifacts with Versioning

For automated CI/CD pipelines, you might want to inject a build number or version:

```
gsoc2 run -- gradle assemble
```

And in `build.gradle`:

```groovy build.gradle
version = System.getenv('BUILD_NUMBER') ?: '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
```

## Advantages of Using Gsoc2 with Gradle

1. **Flexibility**: Easily adapt your Gradle builds to different environments without modifying the build scripts or setting environment variables manually.
2. **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent builds by leveraging the environment variables from the related Gsoc2 project.
3. **Security**: Protect sensitive information by using Gsoc2's secrets management without exposing them in scripts or logs.
