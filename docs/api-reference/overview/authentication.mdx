description: "How to authenticate with the Gsoc2 Public API"
---

The Public API accepts multiple modes of authentication being via [Gsoc2 Token](/documentation/platform/token) or API Key.

- [Gsoc2 Token](/documentation/platform/token): Provides short-lived, scoped CRUD access to the secrets of a specific project and environment.
- API Key: Provides full access to all endpoints representing the user without ability to encrypt/decrypt secrets for **E2EE** endpoints.

        The Gsoc2 Token mode uses an Gsoc2 Token to authenticate with the API.

        To authenticate requests with Gsoc2 using the Gsoc2 Token, you must include your Gsoc2 Token in the `Authorization` header of HTTP requests made to the platform with the value `Bearer <gsoc2_token>`.

        You can obtain an Gsoc2 Token in Project Settings > Service Tokens.
