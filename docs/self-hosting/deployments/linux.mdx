<Info>
Self-host vs. Gsoc2 Cloud

Self-hosting Gsoc2 means managing the service yourself, taking care of upgrades, scaling, security, etc.

If you're less technical and looking for a hands-free experience with minimal overhead then we recommend Gsoc2 Cloud.

</Info>

We provide a docker-compose deployment option for those who want to deploy Gsoc2 onto a Linux VM easily.

1. Install Docker on your VM

```bash
# Example in ubuntu
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt install docker-compose
```

2. Download the required files

```bash
# Download env file template
wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gsoc2/gsoc2/main/.env.example

# Download docker compose template
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gsoc2/gsoc2/main/docker-compose.yml

# Download nginx config
mkdir nginx && wget -O ./nginx/default.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gsoc2/gsoc2/main/nginx/default.dev.conf
```

3. Tweak the `.env` according to your preferences. Refer to the available [environment variables](../../self-hosting/configuration/envars)

```bash
# update environment variables like mongo login
nano .env
```

4. Get the service up and running.

```bash
# Start up services in detached mode
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

5. Your Gsoc2 installation is complete and should be running on [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80). Please note that the containers are not exposed to the internet and only bind to the localhost. It's up to you to configure a firewall, SSL certificates, and implement any additional security measures.
