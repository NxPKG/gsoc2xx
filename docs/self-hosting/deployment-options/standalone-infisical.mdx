The Gsoc2 standalone version combines all the essential components into a single container, making deployment and management more straightforward than other methods. 

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have basic knowledge of Docker and have it installed on your system. If you don't have Docker installed, please follow the official installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

#### System requirements
To have a functional deployment, we recommended compute with **2GB of RAM** and **1 CPU**.
However, depending on your usage, you may need to further scale up system resources to meet demand.

## Pull the Gsoc2 Docker image

Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command to pull the Gsoc2 Docker image:

```
docker pull gsoc2/gsoc2:latest
```

## Run with docker 
To run Gsoc2, we'll need to configure the required configs listed below.
Other configs can be found [here](../configuration/envars)

<ParamField query="ENCRYPTION_KEY" type="string" default="none" required>
  Must be a random 16 byte hex string. Can be generated with `openssl rand -hex 16`
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="AUTH_SECRET" type="string" default="none" required>
  Must be a random 16 byte hex string. Can be generated with `openssl rand -hex 16`
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="MONGO_URL" type="string" default="none" required>
  A MongoDB connection string. Can use any MongoDB PaaS such as Mongo Atlas, AWS Document DB, etc. 
  *TLS based connection string is not yet supported
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="REDIS_URL" type="string" default="none">
  Redis connection string. Only required if you plan to use web integrations or secret reminders.
</ParamField>


Once you have added the required environment variables to your docker run command, execute it in your terminal.

```bash
docker run -p 80:8080  \
-e ENCRYPTION_KEY=f40c9178624764ad85a6830b37ce239a \
-e AUTH_SECRET=5239fea3a4720c0e524f814a540e14a2 \
-e MONGO_URL="<>" \
gsoc2/gsoc2:latest
```

<Warning>
  The above environment variable values are only to be used as an example and should not be used in production 
</Warning>

## Verify the installation:
Once the container is running, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:80. That's it! You have successfully installed the Gsoc2 application using a single Docker image.

<Info>
Once installation is complete, you will have to create the first account. No default account is provided.
