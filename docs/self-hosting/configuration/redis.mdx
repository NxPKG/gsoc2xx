## Why Redis?
As the features and use case of Gsoc2 have grown, the need for a fast and reliable in-memory data storage has become clear. 
By adding Redis to Gsoc2, we can now support more complex workflows such as queuing system to run long running asynchronous tasks, cron jobs, and access reliable cache to speed up frequently used resources. 

<Info>
  Starting with Gsoc2 version v0.31.0, Redis will be required to fully use Gsoc2

### Adding Redis to your self hosted instance of Gsoc2
To add Redis to your self hosted instance, follow the instructions for the deployment method you used.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Kubernetes Helm chart">
    ### In cluster Redis
    By default, new versions of the Gsoc2 Helm chart already comes with an in-cluster Redis instance. To deploy a in-cluster Redis instance along with your Gsoc2 instance, update your Gsoc2 chart then redeploy/upgrade your release. 
    This will spin up a Redis instance and automatically configure it with your Gsoc2 backend. 

    1. Update Gsoc2 Helm chart 
    ```bash
    helm repo update
    ```

    2. Upgrade Gsoc2 release
    ```bash
    helm upgrade <gsoc2 release name> gsoc2-helm-charts/gsoc2  --values <path to your values file>
    ```
    ### External Redis 
    If you want to use an external Redis instance, please add a Redis connection URL under the backend environments variables and then upgrade/redeploy your Gsoc2 instance.

    1. Update your helm values file 
    ```yaml your-values.yaml
    backendEnvironmentVariables:
      REDIS_URL=<your redis connection string>
    ```

    2. Upgrade Gsoc2 release
    ```bash
    helm upgrade <gsoc2 release name> gsoc2-helm-charts/gsoc2  --values <path to your values file>
    ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Docker compose">
    ### Internal Redis service
    By default, new versions of the docker compose file already comes with a Redis service. To use the pre-configured Redis service, please update your docker compose file to the latest version.

    1. Download the new docker compose file
    ```
    wget -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gsoc2/gsoc2/main/docker-compose.yml
    ```
    2. Add Redis environment variable to your .env file
    ```.env .env
      REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
    ```

    3. Restart your docker compose services 
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Standalone Docker image">
    This standalone version of Gsoc2 does not have an internal Redis service. To configure Redis with your Gsoc2 instance, you must connect to a external Redis service by setting the connection string as an environment variable.

    Example: 

    ```bash 
    docker run -p 80:80  \
    -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=f40c9178624764ad85a6830b37ce239a \
    -e JWT_SIGNUP_SECRET=38ea90fb7998b92176080f457d890392 \
    -e JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=7764c7bbf3928ad501591a3e005eb364 \
    -e JWT_AUTH_SECRET=5239fea3a4720c0e524f814a540e14a2 \
    -e JWT_SERVICE_SECRET=8509fb8b90c9b53e9e61d1e35826dcb5  \
    -e REDIS_URL=<> \
    -e MONGO_URL="<>" \
    gsoc2/gsoc2:latest
    ```

    Redis environment variable name: `REDIS_URL`
